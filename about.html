                Welcome everyone! Please allow me to introduce myself and my business.<br><br>

                One of my earliest memories is that of wanting to become a veterinary surgeon. I was about 3 years old when I forced myself to help a little mouse in the garden, even though it scared me at the time. Since then I have grown up surrounded by animals, but horses have always had a special place in my heart. My goal is to make the world a better place for them.<br><br>
                
                Currently Rosie, my 6 year old Dutch Warmblood cross, is my best friend, instant therapy and daily exercise provider. Next to her I live with my great fiance, dog Skye (who is my shadow), cats Midget and Turbo and sheep Lolita and Rambo. And soon, weâ€™re adding a baby to the mix!<br><br>
                
                Being both an equine veterinarian and a horse owner, I can understand your position as a client much better. I happily answer questions about my examinations and treatments all day long if that makes you feel more comfortable. You never have to apologise to me for getting emotional about your four legged friend.<br><br>
                
                With Preventative Equine Care Ltd I hope to fill the need for (specialised) dental care in the area. (Click <a href="qualification differences.html">here</a> for an explanation of the differences in qualifications) Being a veterinary surgeon, I can offer a wide range of services next to that. When I worked in general practice it was great to be able to build up relationships with clients, as it is important to have consistency once you have found a vet that you can trust.
                Staying true to my 3 year old self, I still strive to make the world a better place for all the equines in it. The best way to do that is to prevent disease in the first place. Next to dentistry (Click <a href="routine dental.html">here</a> for an explanation of why routine dental treatment is important.) there are vaccinations, weight management, management of hormonal issues (like Equine Metabolic Syndrome (EMS) and Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (PPID)) and managing the oldtimers. Many of these issues link together, which is why it makes sense to look at the horse as a whole and come up with an individualised approach.
